About me

I am building this webpage to let users know more about myself. Ive added 5 questions with either yes or no answers. I have also put the basic HTML and CSS.

This lab went very well. The if and else statements didnt give me any trouble. Just CSS slowed me down a bit.

About me

I have added two more questions to my quiz. These questions are not simply yes or no. The first one is to have them guess what number i am thinking of, they have four chances. The second was to guess some of my favorite fruits. They had 6 chances for that and there were more than one right answer. Finally I added a counter to let them know how many questions they got right in total. I also added a top ten to the page.

This lab was much more difficult. Loops are very confusing but over all it went well. I got some help and once i figured out what I needed to do it didnt take too long. The final part about adding the total of correct answers I figured out how to do all on my own.
