    Hey there! My name is Alan Christopher Monkman and I am designing this web page to tell you a little about myself. I am a 26 year old man. I live in the city of Lynnwood, just north of Seattle Washington. I grew up in a smaller town called Kenmore that is right off of Lake Washington. After graduating high school I moved around a-lot and worked several different blue-collar jobs. Mostly labor or more recently, delivery jobs. I am a huge nerd. I really enjoy video games and anime, and i've wanted to get more into board games as well. When the Seattle weather allows it, I love to go hiking, fishing, camping or anything of the sort. I want to travel more once I am more financially stable. I spent a month in Vietnam and had a very good experience. Now i am choosing to go back to school in the form of Code Fellows. It is a very new experience for me going to school as an adult but I am really enjoying it so far. Thanks for checking out my page!
